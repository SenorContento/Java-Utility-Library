I haven't created this file yet, but when I do, it will compile the utility library, export it into tar and zip packages, and even create a debian file for Package Cloud and then upload it to Package Cloud. For Nightlies, it will create a sc-utility-jar-dev package, while the master branch will create a normal sc-utility-jar package. It will also make the source code available to apt, so when one runs apt-get source sc-utility-jar or apt-get source sc-utility-jar-dev, then it will either pull from the master branch (probably for the latest master and not for latest version apt knows about) or the nightly branch.
